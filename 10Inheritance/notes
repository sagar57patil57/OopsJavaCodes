mechanism by which a class can inherit data from other class

types :-
1.single
2.multilevel:
    A CLASS(not obj) cannot directly access the grandparentâ€™s members i.e. it cannot use super.super() in child to access grandpa 
3.Hierarchical:
     In Hierarchical Inheritance, one class serves as a superclass (base class) for more than one sub class
4.Multiple:(causes diamond problem)
    In java, we can achieve multiple inheritance only through Interfaces.

Object class is only class with no superclass,if we make a class with no parent then its parent is Object class by default

Constructors are not inherited.only Constructor with no arg is called in childs Constructor.if we want to ru parents Constructor with arg when use SUPER(x, y),etc.

OverRIDING: if child and parent have same static fun name then parent hides child fun
